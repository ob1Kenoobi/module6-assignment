# assignment_module6

A Photo Gallery Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is the starting point for a Photo Gallery Flutter application.
This is an assignment project for the Ostad Flutter course. I have developed the
application according to the specifications given for the assignment. I have added some screenshots
of the application as follows:

1. On the opening screen of the app, We can see the app bar title and a text field for searching for photos.
It also displays the six network images with captions and a list of three sample photos with titles and subtitles.
at the end an upload button.

2. If we click the text field, which is named search, it will show hint text and a keyboard to write the search parameter.

3. Each image triggers a Snackbar when clicked. We can see it in the following image:

4. If we click the upload button, it will display "Photos Uploaded Successfully!" in the Snack bar.

5. If we add more photos and the body gets full, we can also scroll down to access the sample photo list and upload button.
